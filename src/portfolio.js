    'Hi! My name is Kehan and I am a second-year <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/masters-program-overview" class="link" target="_blank">MSCS</a> student at Stanford University, graduating in June 2026. Over the past summer, I interned at <a href="https://stripe.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Stripe</a> as a Software Engineering intern, and previously at <a href="https://www.cepton.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Cepton</a> as a SWE intern.<br><br>My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, and Computer Vision, and I am currently conducting research in the <a href="https://svl.stanford.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">Stanford Vision and Learning (SVL) Lab</a>. Before Stanford, I received my B.A. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, where I conducted research in the <a href="https://darrellgroup.github.io/" class="link" target="_blank">Darrell Group</a>, the <a href="https://www-video.eecs.berkeley.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">VIP Lab</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mpc-lab" class="link" target="_blank">MPC Lab</a>.<br><br>I am actively seeking 2026 full-time opportunities in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) and Software Engineering (SWE).
